            learning blog 
            
            
    This week in introduction to computer sciencewe expanded our knowlage 
    on how to use functions and how they work.
    Last week we learned how to create shapes 
    and this week we used that to make flags
    and an combanation of shapes  overlaping .  Also we learned ho to define
    functions for example if i write the expression
    for a blue square i can put a parenthesis around it and write 
    define and name it anything including numbers
    so every time i want a blue square i just have to say the expresions name
    we also refreshed our knowlage on cornell notes and how there is a detail section 
    and the summary section. while i think it is usefull for note taking it takes a
    while to set up
