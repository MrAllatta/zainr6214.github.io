            learning blog 
            bench mark post
            
                           This blog post is the final post i will be making in the first benchmark and i will be reviewing all of the different core concepts that i have learned over these two months. The very first topic will be about what an expression is and how it relates to computer science . An expression in a programing language is a combination of many different variables ,constants ,as well as functions that a coding language can read.An example of this is 6*(7-2) that is an expression.
 
There are two important parts of an expression which are values and functions. A value is the number(s) that the equation has in the case of  6*(7-2) there are three values which are  6 7 and 2.The two functions in the equation are the multiplication symbol and the minus symbol a function basically the activity that the values are given.\
 
     Circles of evaluation is a process that allows us to translate expressions into something that 
a computer can easily read.It does this by putting all the values and functions in to different places so that it can be rewritten . An example would be the expression  6*(7-2) , with circles of evaluation each parenthesis is  in its own circle and the and the functions are separated in the circle and when the translation is finished the expression 6*(7-2)  will be (*6(-7 2)) which is something that a computer can read
