            learning blog 
            bench mark post
            
      This blog post is the final post i will be making in the first
      benchmark and i will be reviewing all of the different core concepts 
      that i have learned over these two months. The very first topic will
      be about what an expression is and how it relates to computer science.
      An expression in a programing language is a combination of many different
      variables ,constants ,as well as functions that a coding language can read.An
      example of this is 6*(7-2) that is an expression. There are two important parts
      of an expression which are values and functions. A value is the number(s) that the
      equation has in the case of  6*(7-2) there are three values which are  6 7
      and 2.The two functions in the equation are the multiplication symbol and the minus
      symbol a function basically the activity that the values are given.\
 
     Circles of evaluation is a process that allows us to translate expressions into
     something that 
     a computer can easily read.It does this by putting all
     the values and functions in to different places
     so that it can be rewritten . An example would be the
     expression  6*(7-2) , with circles of evaluation
     each parenthesis is  in its own circle and the and the 
     functions are separated in the circle and when 
     the translation is finished the expression 6*(7-2) 
     will be (*6(-7 2)) which is something that a computer 
     can read  

   To expand on how circles of operations work we have to look at another core concept which is called 
   orders of operation. This concept  is does not only help translate an expression by telling us which
   order they are sorted in ,it is also the order that a computer would read anything that it is given.
   
    The next core concept that we learned was contracts and how they worked. A contract with a computer 
    meant that it would only take specific information in the correct pattern and if it could be read then
    the computer would give you something , an example would be an image. If you gave the computer the
    expression (square 420 "solid" "blue” )) then it would show the image of a blue square with an area
    of 420. A computer can show any image when given the correct expression. The concept of coordinates
    is related to contracts because it actually just tells the computer where you want the image to be 
    located which is helpful if you need a more complicated shape 
     
       This brings us to one of our most recent lesson covering definitions. Definitions are a tool
       that a programmer can use which allows them to name an expression like   (square 420 "solid" "blue” ) 
       anything at all for example “banana” when you name an expression this all you have to do to use it
       and get the image is say “banana” and the image of a blue square will appear.
